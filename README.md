# ScroogeCoin

This is the source for my submission for Coursera's [Introduction to Crypto and Cryptocurriences](http://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency) programming assignment 1. The course was created by Princeton University's Arvind Narayanan, professor of Computer Science. I am taking this course in December 2016.

# The Assignment

The goal is to create ScroogeCoin, a cryptocurrency in which the central authority Scrooge receives transactions from users. As the programmer, I have to implement the logic used by Scrooge to process transactions and produce the ledger. Scrooge organizes transactions into time periods or blocks. In each block, Scrooge will receive a list of transactions, validate the transactions he receives, and publish a list of validated transactions.

# The Test Cases

Running 15 tests
Test 1: test isValidTx() with valid transactions
==> passed

Test 2: test isValidTx() with transactions containing signatures of incorrect data
==> passed

Test 3: test isValidTx() with transactions containing signatures using incorrect private keys
==> passed

Test 4: test isValidTx() with transactions whose total output value exceeds total input value
==> passed

Test 5: test isValidTx() with transactions that claim outputs not in the current utxoPool
==> passed

Test 6: test isValidTx() with transactions that claim the same UTXO multiple times
==> passed

Test 7: test isValidTx() with transactions that contain a negative output value
==> passed

Number of transactions returned valid by student = 100
All transactions returned are not satisfied/valid
==> FAILED
