# ScroogeCoin

This is the source for my submission for Coursera's [Introduction to Crypto and Cryptocurriences](http://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency) programming assignment 1. The course was created by Princeton University's Arvind Narayanan, professor of Computer Science. I am taking this course in December 2016.

# The Assignment

The goal is to create ScroogeCoin, a cryptocurrency in which the central authority Scrooge receives transactions from users. As the programmer, I have to implement the logic used by Scrooge to process transactions and produce the ledger. Scrooge organizes transactions into time periods or blocks. In each block, Scrooge will receive a list of transactions, validate the transactions he receives, and publish a list of validated transactions.
